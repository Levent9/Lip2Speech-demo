<h2>Demos from &quot;ZERO-SHOT PERSONALIZED LIP-TO-SPEECH SYNTHESIS WITH FACE IMAGE BASED VOICE CONTROL&quot; </h2>
<p>Paper: TO DO</p>

<p> style="text-align:justify Abstract: Lip-to-Speech (Lip2Speech) synthesis, which predicts the corresponding audio given talking face images, has witnessed significant
  progress with various training strategies and models in a series of
  independent works. However, these works can not achieve voice
  control under zero-shot condition, that extra speaker embedding
  needs to be extracted from the actual reference speech, which is
  unavailable from silent video input. In addition, most of these
  works ignore the match between voice characteristics and face
  for unseen speaker’s speech synthesis. In this paper, we propose
  zero-shot personalized Lip2Speech synthesis, where the face image
  controls speaker identity. Variational autoencoder is introduced to
  our framework for disentangling the speaker identity and linguistic
  content information, that enables voice characteristics controlled
  by the speaker embedding. Furthermore, we propose associated
  cross-modal representation learning to promote the control ability
  of face-based speaker embedding (FSE) to voice characteristics,
  supporting the above Lip2Speech process. Extensive experiments
  verify the effectiveness of the proposed method that synthesized
  unseen speaker’s utterances are more natural and matched with face
  compared with the other methods. To our best knowledge we are the
  first to perform zero-shot personalized Lip2Speech synthesis with
  a face image rather than actual reference audio to control voice
  characteristics. </p><hr />
